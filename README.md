# testRepository

# I am analysing a time series:) IN order to understand and use the code,
# you need to simulate the data. I will add the simulation function afterwards!

# I will add some parts ofto the original code so that you can understand why I have wrote the 
# code aftwerwards! These illustrative codes will be commented using double #. Also: ##

# I try to implement all of the methods, which I have learned so far. After that you can interatively see which one has been better! 

# Your data needs to have the following format:
#  Two columns: 1: Datum   2: Abverkauf 
# I have hard coded these two column names in my code. Maybe I will change it!
